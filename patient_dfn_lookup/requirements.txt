# This file lists the Python dependencies required for the Patient DFN Lookup application.

# The `vavista` library is a custom dependency, expected to be located
# in the project's root directory. It is not available via pip.
# - The 'vavista' directory should be copied directly into the project root.
# - The 'broker_rpc.py' module, which uses vavista, is expected in the 'src' directory.

# Python's built-in tkinter module is used for the GUI and does not
# require explicit installation via pip.

# If there were other standard pip-installable dependencies, they would be listed here, e.g.:
# requests==2.28.1
# cryptography==3.4.8
