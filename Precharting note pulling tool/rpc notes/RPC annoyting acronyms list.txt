  A DFN (Internal Entry Number) is VistA's unique identifier for a patient. It's how the system internally
  tracks and links all patient-related data (notes, labs, orders, etc.). If you don't have access to patient
   DFNs, we won't be able to successfully call any patient-specific RPCs like TIU SUMMARIES, TIU DOCUMENTS
  BY CONTEXT, or TIU GET RECORD TEXT.


âœ¦ Assuming "EIN" is a typo for "IEN" (Internal Entry Number), you can get the IEN for a specific note by first
   listing the available notes for a patient. The IEN is the unique identifier for each note that you'll need
  for RPCs like TIU GET RECORD TEXT.

  Here is the process using the vista_rpc_gui.py application:


   1. List Patient Notes:
       * In the GUI, select the TIU DOCUMENTS BY CONTEXT RPC from the dropdown.
       * Enter the parameters. For example, to get all notes for patient with DFN 100001, you would use:
         literal:3;literal:100001;literal:;literal:;literal:;literal:;literal:;literal:1
       * Click "Invoke RPC".


   2. Identify the IEN from the Response:
       * The "Raw RPC Response" text area will show a list of notes. Each line typically represents a
         different note and starts with its IEN.
       * For example, you might see output like this:

   1         12345^Progress Note^...
   2         12346^Discharge Summary^...
   3         12347^Consult Report^...

       * In this example, 12345, 12346, and 12347 are the IENs for the respective notes.


   3. Use the IEN to Get Note Content:
       * Select the TIU GET RECORD TEXT RPC from the dropdown.
       * In the parameters box, enter the IEN of the note you want to view, like this: literal:12345
       * Click "Invoke RPC" to see the full text of that specific note.

                      FEATURES OF THE KERNEL
WELCOME TO THE KERNEL!

The Kernel is the central set of DHCP utility programs.  This includes
the VA File Manager, Menu Manager, Sign-on/Security System, Device
Handler, Task Manager, and MailMan.  All DHCP application packages,
such as Laboratory or Pharmacy, rest upon the central Kernel utilities.

(As you know, the VA's Decentralized Hospital Computer Program is called
DHCP.  It primarily uses the computer language called MUMPS, that's the
Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multiprogramming System.)

You use the Kernel when you sign-on, navigate among menus, print reports,
or send electronic mail messages.  The Help Processor, the system you are
using right now, is also part of the Kernel.
